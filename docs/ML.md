# Understanding the steps for doing machine learning


Load the data and explore it with visualisations;

Prepare the data for the machine learning algorithm;

Train the model – let the algorithm learn from the data;

Evaluate the model – see how well it performs on data it has not seen before;

Analyse the model – see how much data it needs to perform well.

# Understanding the tooling for machine learning
There are lots of options when it comes to machine learning tooling. In this guide, we use some of the most popular and powerful machine learning libraries, namely:

Python: a high-level programming language known for its readability, and the most popular machine learning language worldwide.

Pandas: a Python library that brings spreadsheet-like functionality to the language.

Seaborn: A library for plotting charts and other graphics.

Scikit learn: A machine learning library for Python, offering simple tools for predictive data analysis.
DRLearn: Our own DataRevenue Learn module, built for this dataset.
